    "**ML Practicals:**\n",

    "1. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for Dimensionality Reduction on Wine Data**  \n",
    "   In this task, you start by loading the wine dataset containing various chemical measurements. After preprocessing the data (e.g., handling missing values), you apply PCA to reduce the number of dimensions. PCA helps by capturing the most variation in fewer components, making it easier to visualize the data and distinguish red and white wine. The PCA transformation process involves standardizing the data, fitting PCA with a chosen number of components, and then transforming the dataset into a new space. The results are visualized, typically in a scatter plot, to show how the main components cluster the wine types.\n",

    "2. **Statistical and Regression Analysis on Diabetes Datasets**  \n",
    "   This problem requires loading the UCI and Pima Indian Diabetes datasets and performing several statistical analyses. The univariate analysis involves calculating descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, variance, skewness, and kurtosis) to understand the distribution of each feature. For bivariate analysis, you create linear and logistic regression models to find relationships between two variables, followed by multiple regression to predict an outcome based on multiple predictors. Finally, comparing these statistics and model outputs between the two datasets highlights any notable differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM) for Handwritten Digit Classification**  \n",
    "   Here, you implement an SVM model to classify images of handwritten digits into classes (0–9). After loading and preprocessing the image data, you split it into training and testing sets. You fit an SVM model to the training data, specifying a kernel type (e.g., linear or radial). The model’s performance on test data is assessed through accuracy and classification reports, highlighting how well the SVM distinguishes between different digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **K-Means Clustering on Iris Dataset**  \n",
    "   In this practical, you implement K-Means clustering on the Iris dataset to group data points. Using the elbow method, you determine the optimal number of clusters by plotting the within-cluster sum of squares for different cluster counts. After choosing an optimal cluster count, K-Means is applied, assigning each data point to a cluster. Visualizations, like scatter plots, illustrate how the clusters group the iris flowers based on their features.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Random Forest Classifier to Predict Car Safety**  \n",
    "   In this task, you load and preprocess a car dataset, then train a Random Forest Classifier model to predict safety levels. Random Forest, an ensemble method, combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy. You split the dataset into training and test sets, fit the Random Forest model, and evaluate it on the test set using accuracy, precision, and recall scores. The feature importance scores provided by the model help understand which features are most influential.\n",

    "**DMV Practicals:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sales Data Analysis from Multiple File Formats**  \n",
    "   This problem involves loading sales data from various formats (e.g., CSV, Excel) into dataframes. You perform data cleaning steps, including handling missing values and removing duplicates, then unify the data into a common format. After transformation tasks like merging datasets or splitting columns, you analyze the sales data with descriptive statistics and visualize it using bar plots, pie charts, and box plots. The visualizations help identify trends, customer behavior, and product performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Weather Data Analysis from OpenWeatherMap API**  \n",
    "   Here, you fetch weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API, extract key attributes (temperature, humidity, wind speed), and preprocess them. You analyze weather patterns by calculating averages and maximum/minimum values over time, visualizing trends with line charts or scatter plots. By aggregating data over different time periods (daily, monthly), you explore relationships between attributes (e.g., temperature and humidity) through correlation plots and heatmaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Customer Churn Analysis in Telecommunications**  \n",
    "   In this task, you import a telecom customer churn dataset and handle missing values and duplicates. Data preprocessing steps include encoding categorical variables and standardizing numerical data. After cleaning, you perform feature engineering by creating relevant new features to help predict customer churn. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, which could later be used in modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Wrangling on Real Estate Market Data**  \n",
    "   This practical focuses on cleaning and organizing real estate data. After handling missing values and encoding categorical variables, you subset the data based on criteria (e.g., time period or location) and aggregate it to calculate metrics like average sale prices by neighborhood. Handling outliers is key to ensuring reliable analysis. This dataset could later be used for further statistical analysis or modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Air Quality Index (AQI) Trend Analysis**  \n",
    "   Here, you load and explore the AQI dataset, focusing on visualizations like line plots to show AQI trends over time. Individual pollutant levels (e.g., PM2.5) are visualized in separate line plots. Bar plots are used for comparing AQI across time periods, while box and scatter plots analyze distribution and relationships between AQI and pollutant levels. These analyses help identify pollution trends and potential correlations between pollutants.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Sales Performance Analysis by Region in Retail**  \n",
    "   In this problem, you load retail sales data and perform regional analysis. You group data by region and calculate total sales per region, visualized through bar or pie charts. You identify top-performing regions and further group data by region and product category to analyze sales patterns. Stacked or grouped bar plots visually compare sales by region and category, helping you assess performance across different regions and product types. \n",
